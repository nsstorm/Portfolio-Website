  <header class="content-header">Background</header>
   	   <article class="main-content">I was born and raised in Upper Michigan, in the Houghton area. This small town atmosphere had a great deal to do with shaping my personality. In a small town, most everybody knows each other and as a result, honesty is extremely valued. After attending Kindergarten through 8th grade, my family moved to the state of Washington, where I attended high school in Battle Ground. <br><br>I'm currently a student at Michigan Tech, and planning to graduate with my Bachelor's of Science, Engineering Management in the Spring of 2017. With this degree, I hope to begin a career in Industrial Engineering and project management.<br><br> After being away from the U.P. for several years, it is exciting to relive some of my childhood memories up here. The contrast between Upper Michigan and the Pacific Northwest is sharp, but could be summed up simply as snow versus rain, respectively.<br><br>In June of 2017, shortly after graduation, I will be marrying my fiance, Kendra. Both of us look forward to beginning a life together, and going wherever the journey takes us. We both are adventurous souls, and we like to spend much of our time exploring new areas. Whether hiking, driving random roads, or trying new coffee shops, the adventure is always worthwhile.<br><br>

     	<header class="content-header">Hobbies</header>
        
     	<article class="main-content">Most of my hobbies involve exploring with Kendra. As a coffee addict, trying out new coffee shops is high on the list. In addition, I love hiking. In my humble opinion, the more difficult the hike and the more I'm tempted to turn back, the greater the view at the end.<br><br>More related to my career, another thing I enjoy immensely is CNC machining. To take a block of steel, plastic, or whatever material it is, and to create a program for the CNC machine which in turn creates a part from said material is just plain awesome. I really enjoy keeping up with the latest technology in this field too, as it seems to be really starting to advance quickly.<br><br></article>

     	<header class="content-header">Looking Forward</header>
     	<article class="main-content">Right now, the two biggest things that I'm looking forward to are graduating from MTU and marrying Kendra. After spending the last 4.5 years at MTU, I'm ready to start my career. As an adventurer, I look forward to the opportunity to explore new parts of the country, as well as learn new skills in my career.<br><br>In the more distant future, I would love to own my own business. Kendra is an very talented baker and decorator, and we both love coffee, so to open a bakery/coffee shop/best place to hangout is a dream we share. More in my skillset, I would love to buy a CNC lathe or mill and start making parts on a contractual basis. Thinking really big, I would love to own an entire machine shop and train and employ a number of skilled machinists.</article>
